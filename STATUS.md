# Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed Components

### **Web UI (`text-ui`)**
Static web interface with:
- Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- File upload form for job submission
- Job status monitoring and results display
- Integration with API endpoints
- Nginx-based serving with proper routing
- Kubernetes deployment with ClusterIP service

### **Ingress Configuration**
External access routing with:
- Nginx ingress controller support
- Path-based routing (`/api` â†’ API service, `/` â†’ Web UI)
- Proper route separation for API and UI traffic
- Local development via `minikube tunnel`

### **API Service (`text-api`)**
Full REST API implementation with:
- Job submission and status endpoints (`POST /api/v1/jobs`, `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}`)
- File upload handling with validation
- PostgreSQL integration with golang-migrate
- Redis queue integration
- Health checks (`/health`, `/ready`, `/stats`)
- Structured logging with slog
- Environment-based configuration with envconfig
- Automatic database migrations on startup
- Comprehensive middleware (CORS, security, logging)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Configurable migration paths via `DB_MIGRATIONS_URL`

### **Worker Service (`text-worker`)**
Background job processor with:
- Redis queue consumer implementation
- Text processing capabilities (word count, line count, case conversion, find/replace, extract)
- Configurable processing delays for stress testing (0-60 second delay support)
- Database status updates
- File processing and result storage
- Worker heartbeat and health tracking
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Concurrent job processing

### **Auto-Scaling Controller (`text-controller`)**
Queue-based auto-scaler with:
- Redis queue depth monitoring (main + priority queues)
- Periodic reconciliation every 30 seconds
- Intelligent scaling logic:
  - Scale up when queue depth > 20 jobs (add up to 2 workers, max 10)
  - Scale down when queue depth < 5 jobs (remove 1 worker, min 1)
  - Jobs per worker capacity: 10 jobs
- Kubernetes deployment scaling using Patch operations
- Prometheus metrics exposition (`queue_depth`, `active_workers`, `autoscaling_events`)
- Health and readiness endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readyz`)
- Graceful shutdown with signal handling
- Structured logging with slog
- See [docs/AUTO_SCALING.md](docs/AUTO_SCALING.md) for detailed architecture

### **Kubernetes Infrastructure**
Complete local deployment setup with:
- **PostgreSQL**: Database deployment with automatic `textprocessing` database creation
- **Redis**: Message queue and caching deployment
- **API Service**: Kubernetes deployment with 2 replicas, health checks, and init containers
- **Worker Service**: Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling (1-10 replicas)
- **Controller Service**: Auto-scaler deployment with RBAC permissions
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for database, Redis, uploads, and results
- **Configuration**: ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment-specific settings
- **Networking**: Internal ClusterIP services with port-forwarding for external access
- **Kustomize**: Environment-specific overlays (development/production)

### **Docker Images**
Multi-stage Docker builds with:
- **API Image**: Optimized Go binary with migration files and non-root user
- **Worker Image**: Lightweight Alpine-based image with text processing capabilities
- **Controller Image**: Minimal Go binary with Kubernetes client libraries
- **Web UI Image**: Nginx-based static file server
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal base images, proper file permissions
- **Build Scripts**: Automated image building and tagging

### **Development Tooling**
- **Makefile**: Comprehensive build, test, and deployment targets
- **Scripts**: Automated build (`build-images.sh`), deploy (`deploy-local.sh`), cleanup (`cleanup.sh`), redeploy controller (`redeploy-controller.sh`)
- **HTTP Client**: Complete API testing suite for JetBrains IDEs (`api-tests.http`)
- **Stress Testing**: Dedicated stress test tool with configurable concurrency and delays
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variables with sensible defaults
- **Database Migrations**: golang-migrate integration with automatic execution

### **Monitoring & Observability** âš¡ In Progress
Complete monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana:
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection from API service and Kubernetes components
  - HTTP request metrics (rate, duration, size)
  - Job creation and queue metrics
  - Database and Redis operation metrics (metrics defined, tracking pending)
  - Kubernetes API server, nodes, and pod metrics
  - Service discovery for automatic target detection
  - RBAC permissions for cluster-wide scraping
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
  - Pre-configured Prometheus datasource
  - Sample API service dashboard with HTTP, job, and resource metrics
  - NodePort access (port 30300) for easy local access
  - Admin credentials: admin/admin
- **API Service Instrumentation**:
  - Custom metrics middleware for HTTP tracking
  - `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
  - Pod annotations for automatic discovery
- See [docs/MONITORING.md](docs/MONITORING.md) for detailed setup and usage

#### Still Pending:
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger or similar
- Structured logging aggregation (ELK/Loki)
- Alert rules and notification channels
- Persistent storage for Prometheus data
- Dashboard provisioning via ConfigMaps
- Metrics for Worker and Controller services
- Database and Redis operation tracking implementation
